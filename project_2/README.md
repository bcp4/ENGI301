This project involved creating a schematic as well as a printed circuit board for an etch a sketch. Students were tasked with importing an SPI screen in addition
to utilizing the libraries from class. Students were then able to submit their boards to macrofab.com and get an estimate for what it might cost to produce 
these PCB boards in bulk. As a result, students were able to gain a better understanding of how to create schematics and wire PCBs, as well as the process of 
documenting such a project for manufacturing and documentation reasons. 
What to expect in project_2
  -final schematic + board for the etch-a-sketch device
  -manufacturing documents (gerber files + assembly + drill files)
  -documentation (photos of top and bottom of board + mechanical drawing) 
  -bill of materials 
  -PDF of final schematic
